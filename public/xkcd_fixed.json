The advisory is printed above them in caps\nsmall-caps Courier type.]]\nTuesday, November 29th, 2005: \nTropical Storm Epsilon . . .\nThe 26th named storm of the apparently never ending 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n[[The same scene, different text.]]\n10 PM Wed: The window of opportunity for strengthening should close in 12-24 hr.\n4 PM Thu: Slow but steady weakening is expected to begin in 12-24 hours.\n\n[[The man with hair now has questions marks above his head.]]\n4 AM Fri: Epsilon does not appear weaker.\n10 AM Fri: Epsilon has been upgraded to a 65-kt hurricane.\n\n[[The two still sit back-to-back.]]\n4 PM Sat: Epsilon has continued to strengthen against all odds . . . [but] can not maintain the current intensity much longer since the environment is becoming increasingly unfavorable.\n\n[[Ditto.]]\n10 PM Sat: Epsilon might or might not still be a hurricane . . . but in any case it likely will not be one on Sunday.\n4 AM Sun: Epsilon is downgraded to a tropical storm. \n\n[[Yep.]]\n10 AM Sun: Morning satellite images indicate that Epsilon has restrengthened.\n\n[[A closer view of just the balding man at his desk.]]\nThere are no clear reasons . . . and I am not going to make one up . . . to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon and I am just describing the facts.\nHowever . . . I still have to make an intensity forecast and the best bet at this time is to predict weakening . . . Epsilon will likely become a remnant low.\nI heard that before about epsilon . . . haven't you?\n\n[[The two men still sit back to back, but the man with hair is now turning his head toward the other man, with his arm resting on the back of his chair. The bald man is leaning forward in his seat, toward his computer while typing.]]\n4 PM Mon: The cloud pattern continues to be remarkably well-organized for a hurricane at such high latitude\nin December.\n\n[[The other man has turned back to his own screen.]]\n10 PM Mon: We have said this before . . . but Epsilon really does not appear as strong this evening as it did this afternoon.\n\n[[Just the bald guy now.]]\n4 AM Tue: \nI have run out of things to say.\n\n[[The two of them again.]]\n10 PM Tue: The end is in sight. It really really is. But in the meantime . . . Epsilon continues to maintain hurricane status. \n4 AM Wed: The end is in sight . . . yes . . . but not quiet yet. I thought I was going to find a weakening system and instead I found that Epsilon is still a hurricane.\n\n[[Ditto.]]\n10 AM  Thu: Convection has vanished and Epsilon is now a tight swirl of low clouds.\nI hope this is the end of the long lasting 2005 hurricane season.\n\n[[This panel is blank and just reads: Nope.]]\n\nEnter Tropical Storm Zeta.\n[[The men are still at their desks. The bald man is leaning back on his chair and staring at his screen, the other man's hair is noticeably disheveled, and he has started growing a five o'clock shadow.]]\nFriday, December 30th, 2005: An elongated area of low pressure . . . which ahd its origins in an old frontal trough . . . began developing organized convection overnight. Advisories are initiated on the 27th tropical storm of 2005.\n\nAny new storms would be in the 2006 season.\n[[The men are still at their desks, the man with hair is even more bedraggled-looking.]]\n4PM Fri: Although the atmosphere seems to want to develop tropical storms ad nauseam . . . the calendar will shortly put an end to the use of the Greek alphabet to name them.\n\nBut 2005's wouldn't end until Zeta did.\n[[The bald man is now wearing a party hat and there is confetti in the air.]]\n10 PM Sat: Zeta appeared on the verge of losing all of its deep convection a few hours ago . . . but since about 21z the convection has been on somewhat of an increase again.\n\n[[A close view of the man with hair at his desk.]]\n10 PM Sun: This is like Epsilon all over again. Most of the conventional guidance suggested that zeta should have been dissipated by now . . . well . . . zeta is pretty much alive at this time. \nI have no choice but to forecast weakening\nagain and again.\n\n[[Both of them at their desks.]]\n4 AM Mon: By 24-36 hours . . . a significant increase in westerly winds . . . should act to shear away most of the associated convection . . . and finally bring the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season to a merciful ending.\n4 PM Mon: It is hard to conceive that a tropical cyclone will be able to survive for very long in such a hostile environment. therefore I have not backed off on the forecast of weakening.\n\n[[And again.]]\n10 PM Mon: Zeta is stronger than yesterday.\n10 AM Wed: As you can see. . . I ran out of things to say.\n\n[[And again.]]\n4 AM Thu: Satellite intensity estimates have decreased. Zeta is downgraded to a 30 kt tropical depression.\n\n[[And again.]]\n10 AM Thu: Shortly after the previous advisory had been issued . . . regretfully . . . the intensity . . . increased to 35 kt and Zeta is a tropical storm once again.\n\n[[And again.]]\n10 PM Thu: Although it seems as if Zeta will never die . . . the forecast continues to show weakening.\n\n[[Both men are now leaning back in their chairs, exhausted.]]\n4 PM, Friday, January 6, 2006: Zeta no longer meets the criteria of a tropical cyclone. . . which means that both it and the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season have ended. \nThis is the national hurricane center signing off for 2005.\n\n[[The bald man still sits at his desk, the man with hair is no longer in his chair.]]\n\n[[Again, we see the bald man at his desk and the other guy's empty desk.]]\nBald guy: Actually, Zeta's cloud pattern is\u0085\nHair guy: (out of panel) NO.\nBald guy: Ok. \n\n{{Title text: The average error in the NHC forecasted position of a hurricane three days in the future has shrunk to a third of what it was in 1990--a staggering accomplishment.

Here, each quote is given as a separate panel. Attribution is delimited with a --. Some text is bolded; it is enclosed in asterisks.))\n*The art of letter-writing is fast dying out.* When a letter cost nine pence, it seemed but fair to try to make it worth nine pence... Now, however, we think we are too busy for such old-fashioned correspondence. *We fire off a multitude of rapid and short notes, instead of sitting down to have a good talk over a real sheet of paper.*\n-- The Sunday Magazine\n1871\n\nIt is, unfortunately, one of the chief characteristics of modern business to be always in a hurry. *In olden times it was different.*\n-- The Medical Record\n1884\n\nWith the advent of cheap newspapers and superior means of locomotion... the dreamy quiet old days are over... for *men now live think and work at express speed.* They have their \nMercury\n or \nPost\n laid on their breakfast table in the early morning, and if they are too hurried to snatch from it the news during that meal, they carry it off, to be *sulkily read as they travel... leaving them no time to talk with the friend who may share the compartment with them*... the hurry and bustle of modern life... lacks the quiet and repose of the period when our forefathers, the day's work done, took their ease...\n-- William Smith, Morley: Ancient and Modern\n1886\n\nConversation is said to be a lost art... good talk presupposes leisure, both for preparation and enjoyment. *The age of leisure is dead, and the art of conversation is dying.*\n-- Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly, volume 29\n1890\n\nIntellectual laziness and the hurry of the age have produced *a craving for literary nips*. The torpid brain... has grown too weak for sustained thought. \n*There never was an age in which so many people were able to write badly*. \n-- Israel Zangwill, The Bachelors' Club\n1891\n\n*The art of pure line engraving is dying out. We live at too fast a rate* to allow for the preparation of such plates as our fathers appreciated. If a picture catches the public fancy, the public must have an etched or a photogravured copy of it within a month or two of its appearance. The days when engravers were wont to spend two or three years over a single plate are for ever gone. \n-- Journal of the Institute of Jamaica, volume 1\n1892\n\nSo much is exhibited to the eye that *nothing is left to the imagination*. It seems almost possible that the modern world might be choked by its own riches, *and human faculty dwindle away amid the million inventions that ahve been introduced to render its exercise unnecessary*.\nThe articles in the quarterlies extend to thirty or more pages, but *thirty pages is now too much*. So we witness a further condensing process and, we have the \nfortnightly\n and the \ncontemporary\n which reduce thirty pages to *fifteen pages* so that you may read a larger number of articles in a shorter time and in a shorter form. As if this last condensing process were not enough the condensed articles of these periodicals are *further condensed* by the daily papers, which will give you *a summary of the summary* of that which has been written about everything. \n*Those who are dipping into so many subjects and gathering information in a summary and superficial form lose the habit of settling down to great works*. \nEphemeral literature is driving out the great classics of the present and the past... *hurried reading can never be good reading*. \n-- G. J. Goschen, First annual address to the students, Toynbee Hall, London\n1894\n\nThe existence of *mental and nervous degeneration among a growing class of people*, especially in large cities, is an obvious phenomenon... the mania for stimulants... diseases of the mind are almost as numerous as the diseases of the body... this intellectual condition is characterized by *a brain incapable of normal working... in a large measure due to the hurry and excitement of modern life*. with its facilities for rapid locomotion and almost instantaneous communication between remote points of the globe*...\n-- The Churchman, volume 71\n1895\n\nIf we *teach the children how to play* and encourage them in their sports... *instead of shutting them in badly ventilated schoolrooms*, the next generation will be more joyous and will be heailthier than the present one. \n-- Public Opinion: A Comprehensive Summary of the Press Throughout the World, volume 18\n1895\n\nThe cuase of the... increase in nervous disease is *increased demand made by the coditions of modern life upon the brain*. Everything is done in a hurry. *We talk across a continent, telegraph across an ocean*, take a trip to Chicago for an hour's talk... *We even take our pleasures sadly and make a task of our play*... What wonder if the pressure is almost more than our nerves can bear. \n-- G. Shrady (from P. C. Knapp) \"Are nervous diseases increasing?\" Medical Record\n1896\n\n*The managers of sensational newspapers*... do not try to educate their readers and make them better, but tend to *create perverted tastes and develop vicious tendencies*. The owners of these papers seem to have but one purpose, and that is to increase their circulation.\n-- Medical Brief, volume 26\n1898\n\n*To take sufficient time for our meals seems frequently impossible* on account of the demands on our time made by our business... we act on the apparent belief that all of our business is so pressing that we must jump on the quickest car home, eat our dinner in the most hurried way, make the closest connection for car returning... \n-- Louis John Rettger, Studies in Advanced Physiology\n1898\n\nIn these days of increasing rapid artificial locomotion, *may I be permitted to say a word in favour of a very worthy and valuable old friend of mine, Mr Long Walk?*\n*I am afraid that this good gentleman is in danger of getting neglected, if not forgotten*. We live in days of water trips and land trips, excursions by sea, road and rail- bicycles and tricycles, tram cars and motor cars... but in my humble opinion, good honest walking exercise for health beats all other kinds of locomotion into a cocked hat. \n-- T. Thatcher, \"A plea for a long walk\", The Publishers' Circular\n1902\n\nThe art of conversation is almost a lost one. *People talk as they ride bicycles - at a rush - without pausing to consider their surroundings*... What has been generally understood as cultured society is rapidly deteriorating into baseness and voluntary ignorance. *The profession of letters is so little understood*, and so far from being seriously appreciated, that... newspapers are full, not of thoughtful honestly expressed public opinion on the affairs of the nation, but of vapid personalities interesting to none save gossips and busy bodies. \n-- Marie Corelli, Free Opinions, Freely Expressed\n1905\n\nThere is a great *tendency among the children of today to rebel against restraint*, not only that placed upon them by the will of the parent, but against any restraint or limitation of what they consider their rights... this fact has filled well minded people with great apprehensions for the future. \n-- Rev. Henry Hussmann, The Authority of Parents\n1906\n\n*Our modern family gathering, silent* around the fire, *each individual with his head buried in his favourite magazine*, is the somewhat natural outcome of the banishment of colloquy from the school...\n-- The Journal of Education, volume 29\n1907\n\nPlays in theatres at the present time present spectacles and *deal openly with situations which no person would have dared to mention in general society forty years ago*... The current representations of *nude men and women in the daily journals* and the illustrated magazines would have excluded such periodicals from all respectable families two decades ago... Those who have been divorced... forty and fifty years ago lost at once and irrevocably their standing in society, while to-day they continue in all their social relationships, hardly changed...\n-- Editorial, The Watchman, Boston\n1908\n\nWe write millions more letters than did our grandfathers, but the increase in volume has brought with it an automatic artificial machine-like ring... an examination of a file of old letters reveals not only a remarkable grasp of details, but a *fitness and courtliness too often totally lacking* in the mechanical curt cut and dried letters of to-day. \n-- Forrest Crissey, Handbook of Modern Business Correspondence\n1908\n\n*A hundred years ago it took so long and cost so much to send a latter that it seemed worth while to put some time and thought into writing it*. Now the quickness and the cheapness of the post seem to justify the feeling that *a brief letter to-day may be followed by another next week - a \"line\" now by another to-morrow*. \n-- Percy Holmes Boynton, Principles of Composition \n1915\n\n{{Title text: 'Unfortunately, the notion of marriage which prevails ... at the present time ... regards the institution as simply a convenient arrangement or formal contract ... This disregard of the sanctity of marriage and contempt for its restrictions is one of the most alarming tendencies of the present age.' --John Harvey Kellogg, Ladies' guide in health and disease (1883)}}", "comic": "xkcd"}

It has rounded corners and it is gray with white text. From this box there is a gray line to a box consisting of a black frame with rounded corners. In these kind of boxes there are questions regarding the map in black text. Below this box there are three gray boxes like the start box, superimposed over the bottom frame. In these boxes are the possible answers to the question in the frame above. From each of these options there is a gray line going to similar black framed boxes with other questions either below, or to either side. There can either be two, three or four gray boxes, two the most common. Only at the very bottom of the central branch where it turns out it was a home made map, are there two frames with only one gray question box each. This trend continues over this entire large image. When reaching the end of a branch in the flow chart, there is no line away from one, more or all of the gray boxes for a black frame. When this happens a year range or a guess at what the map shows, or what it is (if it turns out to not be a map) is written below the gray box in gray text.

There are three several signs up the left sign, and possible another three small signs at the bottom of the window. The top right corner has a curved line around the corner. No text is visible on the door. Next to the door is another square. It could be a window of a place to post things. There are one large posters to the left with unreadable text and to the top right another smaller white rectangle. Below along the bottom of the square there are three small rectangles shown in full, and two more is only partly shown, which could indicate that it is a window and that they are inside the store.

But the bottom whisker of the first is longer than the last. If the middle box is about 1.9 cm high it will have a 1 cm whiskers below and an 0.8 cm whisker at the top for a total length of 3.7 cm. Then the first box would be 1.7 cm high with the bottom whisker 0.8 cm, and the top whisker 0.5 cm for a total length of 3 cm. The last box is then 1.4 cm high with the top whisker being 0.6 cm and the bottom 0.5 cm, for a total length of 2.5 cm. The boxes are 0.7 cm wide and the end lines for the whiskers are 0.5 cm wide. The data points stay in the same place and have the same dimensions through all five panels, except the middle point which changes as explained below in the last two panels.]\n[Cueball walks into the panel from the left looking up at the top of the first box.]\n[Cueball climbs on to the first box, by holding on to the top and stem of the first whisker, while putting a bend leg on the top of the box, while the other legs hangs down the side of the box.]\n[Cueball now stands on top of the plot, with one foot on the first box and a second foot on the middle box. He is bend over the whisker on the middle box, holding on to it with both hands, one on either side of the middle stem. He is pushing it up and down, as indicated with two light gray version of Cueball's arms and the stem, with the stem in the top gray version being about 0.1 cm above the original height and with Cueball thus with more bend arms than in the normal black version. He has thus pulled the \"lever\" a bit further up. The second gray version is in between these two, about 0.2 cm below the upper gray, and thus 0.1 cm below the original position and thus with a bit less bend arms that the top gray. In the final black version where the arms are almost stretched, the top is now only 0.5 cm over the box, 0.3 cm below the original position, further 0.2 cm below the second gray. On top of all this the middle box also increases its width bulging out in the top part with a maximum bulge around 0.6 cm below the top, to a width of 1.1 cm. That the movement of Cueball goes both ways are indicated both with 6 small double lines around Cueball's shoulders, arms and hands, but also by the sound his actions make.]\n[Finally Cueball has climbed down and walks away to the right, the panel panning a bit after him so the inflated box plot moves to the left in the panel. The middle box is now inflated evenly so the maximum bulge is at the middle and it is almost touching the other two boxes with a width of 1.4 cm, double the original thickness. There have all the time been 1.5 cm between the edges of the two other boxes, so the inflated box does not interfere with the other two, but is very close to their edges. The whisker at the bottom of the middle box is unchanged but the top whisker ended up being only 0.6 cm high, 0.2 cm lower than original position, but a 0.1 cm higher than when Cueball pushed down on it in the previous panel.]\n\n\n", "comic": "xkcd"}

Where it stops a pink row of states begins. Beneath this runs a yellow row, except it does not take California with it, since it belongs to the next purple line beneath this yellow line. Finally the two states not in the contiguous states as well as the southern states from Texas to Florida are again pink. Inside each state is written one, and only one word (or for small states the word is outside and if needed a line indicates which state it belongs to). The words size depends on the size of the state and the word. If it can fit inside the state it will be written in a font large enough to fill the entire state if possible (in one case a hyphen is used). So a short word, like \"lets\" in huge Texas becomes huge, but a word like \"noise\" which has been fitted inside small Massachusetts becomes small.][Here are the 50 words written in lines resembling the colors on the map (from left to right).

Only the lines for 0% (the x-axis), 50% (the line starting halfway up the graph), and 100% (the top of the graph) are labeled.  Except for the x-axis and the top line, these \"horizontal\" grid lines are not straight: they start out horizontally, but by the time they have met the first vertical line, representing the first data point, they have diverged significantly from their original positions. The lines representing 20% to 90% curve upwards and then back to horizontal, so that the eight lines representing y-axis values from 20%-90% are, after the first data point, squeezed into the top 10% of the area of the graph.  From this point onwards, the line representing 20% is horizontally even with the label for the 90% line, and the 30%-90% lines are evenly spaced between the 20% line and the 100% line at the top of the graph.

At extreme left, an arrow pointing down and to the left, labeled \"To Sun, very very far down\". From left to right the gravity wells depicted are: Mercury; Venus; Earth, 5,478 km; Moon, 288 km; Mars, 1,286 km; Ganymede; Io; Jupiter; Europa; Titan, with two small bumps captioned \"WEEOOOEEOOOEEEOOO\"; Saturn, with its rings depicted as various-colored horizontal bands; Uranus; and Neptune, with a figure exclaiming, \"An even more glorious dawn awaits!\"\n\nInset below Earth, the Moon, and Mars are three panels depicting Mars', Deimos's, and Phobos's gravity wells. The Mars inset shows Mars' gravity well, 1,286 km deep, in relation to its moons, Deimos and Phobos, and a NASA Mars Exploration Rover. The Deimos inset shows Deimos' gravity well and a person, labeled \"to scale\"; the gravity well is approximately two thirds the height of the person, and the caption reads, \"You could escape Deimos with a bike and a ramp.\" The Phobos inset is similar, except that the gravity well is approximately three times the height of the person included for scale, and reads, \"A thrown baseball could escape Phobos.\"\n\nTo the right of Jupiter's gravity well is a diagram of a well. The height of the well is labeled \"very deep\"; at the bottom is a figure labeled \"your mom\"; and three figures, labeled \"local football team\", are shown falling in head first. Beneath that, the text reads, \"Jupiter is not much larger than Saturn, but much more massive. At its size, adding more mass just makes it denser due to the extra squeezing of gravity. If you dropped a few dozen more Jupiters into it, the pressure would ignite fusion and make it a star.\"\n\nAt the right of the panel is an inset diagram detailing Earth's gravity well, which is labeled as being 6,379 km deep. Also depicted are the altitudes of low Earth orbit, the ISS, the Space Shuttle, GPS satellites, geosynchronous orbit, and the Moon's gravity well, 288 km deep. A figure standing on the Earth's \"surface\" says, \"This is why it took a huge rocket to get to the moon, but only a small one to get back.\" Beneath that, the text, \"It takes the same amount of energy to launch something on an escape trajectory away from Earth as it would to launch it 6,000 km upward under constant 9.81 m\ns\u00b2 Earth gravity. Hence, Earth's well is 6,000 km deep.\"\n))\nGravity wells, scaled to Earth surface gravity\n\nThis chart shows the 'depth' of various solar system gravity wells.\n\nEach well is scaled such that rising out of a physical well of that depth -- in constant Earth surface gravity -- would take the same energy as escaping from that planet's gravity in reality.\n\nEach planet is shown cut in half at the bottom of its well, with the depth of the well measured down to the planet's _flat_ surface.\n\nThe planet sizes are to the same scale as the wells.

The upper terminal leads to a line that is going to the upper terminal of that cloverleaf and to a battery symbol (with the + and - symbols on the wrong ends) with a value of \u00e2\u0088\u009a2V.  The right terminal of the cloverleaf is going into a resistor symbol label \"120\u00ce\u00a9 or to taste\".  Connected to the other terminals of the resistor and battery is a switch that is labeled \"glue open\".  The bottom of the two lines has a transistor with two emitters, one P and one N, and no collector.  The P-type emitter is connected to the top line and a jar of scarab beetles.  Above the beetles is a resistor labeled \"brown blue orange\". To the right is an unlabeled resistor with a center tap going into a capacitor, with a ground on the other end.  Above the capacitor is a diode, and below an inductor.  To the right is another inductor.  The two inductors and ground are all covered by a \"solder blob\".  The rightmost component is a \"666 timer\" that has pin 5 going into a question mark.\n\nBack to the left side, below and to the left of the cloverleaf is a compass rose.  The bottom terminal of the cloverleaf is connected to a battery, labeled 50V, with grounds on both sides.  To the right of the battery is a long horizontal wire that is labeled \"pull this wire really tight.\"  That wire is hooked up to a vertical wire that connects to the N-type emitter of the transistor above it.  To the right is an AC source that is labeled 240V, shorted out, with a label on the short \"omit this if you're a wimp.\"  To the right of that is an inductor that is labeled with \"11kg\", a batman symbol, and a squirrel.\n\nBack to the left end of the diagram, where the blender is, there is a wire that is labeled as a distance 3\n8\" from the wire with the 50V battery.  To the right there is a frowny face, then a vertical wire with a 90 degree bend labeled \"caution \u00e2\u0086\u00b1\".  That leads into a balloon.  Under the balloon is an inductor symbol with a line on the bottom edge labeled as \"warm front\".\n\nUnderneath the blender and to the right of the Arduino is a resistor labeled \"\u00eb\".  To the right is an electric eel, a capacitor, an unlabeled resistor, and a gob of hot glue attached to a chip with an inverter hooked to an XOR gate, both with feedback into each other.  Under the electric eel is a neck strap.  To the right of the XOR gate and inverter is a bridge rectifier labeled as \"Moral rectifier\"  to the right again is a bottle of magic smoke, under that a fishing bobber and then a broken wire labeled with a question mark. \n\nUnder the most expensive chip available there is a vertical wire labeled with \"electrons single file\".  To the right is a switch labeled \"hire someone to open and close switch real fast.\"  To the right of that is a contact labeled \"touche tongue here\".  Below that is a resistor labeled \"5\u00ce\u00a9 (decoy)\" with only one terminal connected.  To the right of the contact is a methyl group attchaed to a wire.  To the right of the methyl group is a complex mesh of 1\u00ce\u00a9 resistors labeled with \"oh, so you think you're such a whiz at EE201?\"\n\nConnected to the wire labeled \"electrons single file\" is a wire bent in a U shape with an upside-down ground on the end.  To the right is a flux capacitor with the bottom wire labeled I-95.  To the right of that is a wire labeled yarn, then an arena with two diodes going in and one leaving.  The right diode has a ground on its anode labeled \"bury deep, but not too deep.\"  To the right of that is a motor labeled vibrator, resistor with a value of \u00cf\u0080, and a 500V AC source.\n\nUnder the flux capacitor is a wire that leads out of frame with a label \"\u00e2\u0086\u0090 to center of sun\".  To the right is a 55 MPH speed limit sign, then an SR latch (flip-flop) labeled \"may use an actual sandal instead\".  Connected to the Q of the SR latch is a holding pen and to the inverting Q output is a wire in a knot, a resistor labeled \"8mm\", a resistor symbol labeled \"not a resistor; wire just does this\", and a motor symbol labeled \"to scale\".\n\nUnder the wire that leads off to the center of the sun is a tangled mess of wires connected and jumping over each other, then a photo diode labeled \"tear collector\".  Under the tear collector is a wire in the shape of a ECG.  To the right is a light bulb, a capacitor-looking symbol labeled 3 liters, a resistor labeled yes, an unlabeled inductor, a resistor with a question mark as a label.  To the right of all that is an inductor labeled \"take off shirt while wiring this part.  Ooh, yeah, I like that.\"  Finally, in the lower right hand corner is a ground symbol immersed in a beaker of holy water.]]", "comic": "xkcd"}

Apologies from the transcriber, who did her best to include as much as she could without going nuts.]]\n\n((Label in the center of main map.))\nUpdated Map of Online Communities\nSize on map represents volume of Daily Social activity (posts, chat, etc). Based on data gathered over the \nSpring and Summer of 2010\n\n[[Two insets on the upper left-hand corner shows that this map is a tiny portion of the huge continent of Spoken Language, encompassing portions of the Internet, Email, and Cell Phones (SMS).]]\n\n[[The largest landmass on the map by far, which takes up nearly the entire northern half of the map is \"Facebook\" -- with large states in the southeast of the country labeled 'Farmville' and 'Happy Farm'. There is a much smaller state to the west of these called 'Farm Town'. To the north of these states is a large swath of unremarkable land entitled 'Northern Wasteland of Unread Updates.' This is directly north of the large Dopamine Sea.\n\nA peninsula on the southwest, just below the Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions, houses many tiny states, such as MySpace, Orkut, LinkedIn, Bebo, & Hi5. It is bordered on the south by Buzzword Bay, which contains several islands of varying sizes. Among these are YouTube and Twitter (the largest), which are separated by the Social Media Consultant Channel. To the southeast of Twitter, across the Sea of Protocol Confusion, is another, equally large island. Most of it is Skype, with the north having two largish states called AIM and Windows Live Messenger. On the southwest part of the island are two smaller states called GG and Yahoo Messenger.\n\nThe Island of Skype is extremely close to, but separated by the Great Firewall (a dashed line), the large landmass of QQ. It's north shore is the Gulf of China and Grass Mud Horse Bay. Outside of these bays, over the Great Firewall are two islands called Craigslist and 2Channel.\n\nIn the Dopamine Sea, off the southern shores of Farmvile and Happy Farm, is MMO Isle. Its largest state is WoW, with Runescape, Lineage, Maple Story, Habbo, and the Mountains of Steam among its notable landmarks. To the southeast of the island is the Gulf of Lag, in which sits the CDC Games island, with Eve Online.\n\nTo the east of Twitter is Troll Bay, with such islands as Reddit and Reddit, Digg, Stumbleupon, Delicio.us, and Wikipedia Talk Pages. To their south are the IRC isles, of which one is the tiny island of #xkcd.\n\nEast of these islands, and north of Skype island, is the Sea of Memes. In this sea, to the north of Craigslist and 2Channel, is an archipelago of tiny islands. There is an inset, labeled 'Forums.' (See below.)\n\nTo the southwest if Twitter island, in the Sea of Opinions, are the blog islands. These lie south of the islands in Buzzword Bay, as well. The northernmost islands in this group are centered around the Bay of Drama, on which can be found Diary Blogs, Gossip Blogs, and Livejournal. Gossip Blogs share an island with Political, Music, and Tech Blogs. To the north of this island is a smaller island called Photo Blogs. South of Diary Blogs, and off the southwest coast of Music blogs is a smaller island called Fandom Blogs. South of Tech Blogs, off of which sprouts the small peninsula of Business Blogs, is the Spamblog Straits. On the other side of the straits is a large island made up of Miscellaneous Blogs, with two states demarcated as Religious Blogs and Blog Blogs. Southwest of the Blog Islands is the Sea of Zero (0) Comments.]]\n\n[[An inset of a group of islands in the sea of memes located on the lower right corner of the map, labeled 'Forums'. The largest by far is 4chan and \nb\n. Also found here are D2JSP, JLA Frums, Fan Forum, Something Awful, and many smaller ones, too numerous to list here.]]\n\n[[The northeastern third of Gossip\nPolitical\nTech Blogs island is another inset labeled 'Blogosphere (Core)'. This can be found on the lower left corner of the map. Two peninsulas in Political Blogs bookend the Bay of Flame -- these are Liberal Blogs and Conservative Blogs. Between them lie several tiny islands such as Politics Daily, CNN Politcal Ticker, and Mediaite. Off the coast of Liberal Blogs lies the island of NYTimes, off the coast of Conservative Blogs is Libertarian Isle. Between the two lies The Talk. The northern peninsula of Tech Blogs contains places such as Gizmodo, Engadget, Joystiq, and Kotaku.]] \n\n((Text found between the two insets, which are directly below the main map.))\nABOUT THIS MAP\nCommunities rise and fall, and total membership numbers are no longer a good measure of a community's current size and health. This updated map uses size to represent total social activity in a community -- that is, how much talking, playing sharing, or other socializing happens there. This meant some paring of apples and oranges, but I did my best and tried to be consistent.\n\nEstimates are based on the numbers I could find, but involved a great deal of guesswork, statistical inference, random sampling, nonrandom sampling, a 20,000-cell spreadsheet, emailing, cajoling, tea-leafing reading, goat sacrifices, and gut instinct (i.e. making things up).\n\nSources of data include Google and Bing, Wiipedia, Alexa, Big-Boards.com, StumbleUpon, Wordpress, Akismet, every website statistics page I could find, press releases, news articles, and individual site employees. Thanks in particular to folks at Last.fm, LiveJournal, Reddit, and the New York Times, as well as sysadmins at a number of sites who shared statistics on condition of anonymity.\n\n{{Title text: Best trivia I learned while working on this: 'Man, Farmville is so huge!

Areas near the poles in this projection are fairly distorted, but the distortion is greatly reduced when moving toward the equator.]]\nYou have a comfortable pair of running shoes that you wear everywhere. You like coffee and enjoy the Beatles. You think the Robinson is the best-looking projection, hands down.\n\nWinkel-Tripel\n[[The Winkel-Tripel projection is similar to the Robinson projection, with less distortion at the poles. However the distortion at equivalent latitudes differs as the longitude varies.]]\nNational Geographic adopted the Winkel-Tripel in 1998, but you've been a W-T fan since \nlong\n before \"Nat Geo\" showed up. You're worried it's getting played out, and are thinking of switching to the Kavrayskiy. You once left a party in disgust when a guest showed up wearing shoes with toes. Your favourite musical genre is \"post-\".\n\nHobo-Dyer\n[[The Hobo-Dyer projection is a cylindrical projection resulting in significant latitudinal distortion. The result is a rectangular image with the poles vertically compressed, and land near the equator stretched.]]\nYou want to avoid cultural imperialism but you've heard bad things about Gall-Peters. You're conflict-averse and buy organic.l You use a recently-invented set of gender-neutral pronouns and think that what the world needs is a revolution in consciousness.\n\nA globe!\n[[It's a globe.]]\nYes, you're very clever.\n\nPierce Quincuncial\n[[This is a square projection centred over the north pole. The continents stretch out radially from the centre of the map and bits of Antarctica are visible in each corner of the projection.]]\nYou think that when we look at a map, what we really see is ourselves. After you first saw \nInception\n, you sat silent in the theater for six hours. It freaks you out to realise that everyone around you has a skeleton inside them. You \nhave\n really looked at your hands.\n\n((The second column of projections starts here.))\n\nVan Der Grinten\n[[This projection displays the continents inside a perfectly circular frame. The continents are displayed with similar distortion to what you would see in the Robinson or Winkel-Tripel projections.]]\nYou're not a complicated person. You love the Mercator projection; you just wish it weren't so square. The earth's not a square, it's a circle. You like circles. Today is gonna be a good day!\n\nDymaxion\n[[The Dymaxion projection attempts to unfold the earth into a polyhedral net, centred on the north pole. The map has no set shape, instead it looks to be made out of a series of triangles.]]\nYou like Isaac Asimov, XML, and shoes with toes. You think the segway got a bad rap. You own 3D goggles, which you use to view rotating models of better 3D goggles. You type in Dvorak.\n\nGoode Homolosine\n[[The Goode Homolosine projection attempts to minimise distortion by combining two equal area projections onto a split projection. The map resembles a smooth unfolded net, with landmasses kept whole where possible.]]\nThey say mapping the earth on a 2D surface is like flattening an orange peel, which seems easy enough to you. You like easy solutions. You think we wouldn't have so many problems if we'd just elect \nnormal\n people to congress instead of politicians. You think airlines should just buy food from the restaurants near the gates and serve \nthat\n on board. You change your car's oil, but secretly wonder if you really \nneed\n to.\n\nPlate Carr\u00e9e\n(Equirectangular)\n[[This projection maps latitude and longitude to a rectangular grid, leading to significant longitudinal distortion near the poles.]]\nYou think this one is fine. You like how \nx\n and \ny\n map to latitude and longitude. The other projections overcomplicate things. You want me to stop asking about maps so you can enjoy dinner.\n\nWaterman Butterfly\n[[This projection unfolds the world into a net, similar to the Dymaxion projection. It is centred on the Atlantic, and resembles a butterfly with the Americas on the western wing, with Europe and Africa on the eastern wing.]]\nReally? You know the Waterman? Have you seen the 1909 Cahill map it's based-- ...You have a framed reproduction at home?! Whoa. ...Listen, forget these questions. Are you doing anything tonight?\n\nGall-Peters\n[[Another rectangular projection, this map suffers significant distortion near the poles, and significant latitudinal distortion in general.]]\nI \nhate\n you.\n\n{{Title text: What's that? You think I don't like the Peters map because I'm uncomfortable with having my cultural assumptions challenged?
